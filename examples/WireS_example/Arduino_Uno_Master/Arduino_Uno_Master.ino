/*
    WireS Library: Arduino-Uno-Side (Master)
    ----------------------------------------

    INTRODUCTION
    ------------
    The following sketch provides a simple example of setting up an ATtiny841 as an I2C Slave device
    on the I2C bus and an Arduino Uno as the I2C Master.

    At runtime, the Arduino Master will request 4 bytes from the ATtiny841 Slave and then print them
    out using the Serial Monitor.

    HW SETUP
    --------
    - Connect Arduino Pin A4 (HW SDA) to ATtiny841 Pin PA6 (SW SDA) with a 2K2 pull-up resistor to 5V
    - Connect Arduino Pin A5 (HW SCL) to ATtiny841 Pin PA4 (SW SCL) with a 2K2 pull-up resistor to 5V
    - Follow the basic hookup for Arduino & ATtiny841 (Common Ground for both ICs, 100nF decoupling capacitors,
      10K pullup resistors for RESET pins, and if needed, external crystals)


    RUNNING THE SKETCH
    ------------------
    Upload this sketch to the Arduino Uno and the other example sketch (ATtiny841_Slave.ino) to the
    ATtiny841. Then open the Serial Monitor (make sure the Baud Rate is set to 9600).
